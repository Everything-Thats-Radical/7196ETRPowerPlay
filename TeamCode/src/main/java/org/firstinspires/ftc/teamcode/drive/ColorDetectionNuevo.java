    // An open letter to the reader of this code:

    // You may notice that there are many spelling mistakes in this document,
    // and that many of those mistakes were copied and pasted several times,
    // making them even more pronounced and obvious. It is to my great
    // disappointment that I inform you that it was indeed the great
    // Rocco John D'Antico, in the 2021-2022 Freight Frenzy FTC season,
    // who misspelled everything here. I neither have the time nor the mental
    // strength necessary to correct whatever he managed to mess up while
    // the fact that he was messing up was highlighted before his very eyes
    // by JetBrains' very convenient but apparently unused grammar checking
    // tools in Android Studio.
    //
    // Instead, I compose this poem to commemorate Rocco for the great feats he
    // accomplished with his great coding ability, but to also add nuance to that
    // praise with the confusion and despair his team was left with once they opened
    // his code the following season:

    /*
    My fierce Rocco, you inspire me to write.
    How we love the way you code and misspell,
    Invading our minds day and through the night,
    Always dreaming about the mademoiselle.

    Let us compare you to a bold cherry?
    You are more mighty, hard-working and brave.
    Ice bites the debris of February,
    And wintertime has the amazing rave.

    How do we love you? Let us count the ways.
    We love your bad at spelling bravery.
    Wanting your handsomeness fills my days.
    Our love for you is the old slavery.

    Now we must away with a chemic heart,
    Remember our grave words whilst we're apart.
